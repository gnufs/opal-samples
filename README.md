Opal Samples
=============

What are these?
---------------

Code samples I came up with during my study of Opal at Berlin Institute of Technology.

[Opal](http://projects.uebb.tu-berlin.de/opal/trac) is a functional algebraic language, developed and used mainly at BIT.

Other code samples can also be found on http://code.google.com/p/opal-examples/

License
========

All code in this repository that were written by me are licensed under MIT license which can be found in the LICENSE file.

However, as is in the nature of code written during a class, parts of the code were developed by the lecturer(s) or collectively during the classes. Even though I don't think anybody would actually need to reuse this source code for reasons other than learning the language, I recommend contacting me if that is your intention to try to clear out the legalities.
